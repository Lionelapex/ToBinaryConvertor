# ToBinaryConvertor


## Project Overview
The Binary Number Converter is a simple web application designed to convert decimal numbers into their binary equivalents. This project was created to expand on a lesson learned about binary number systems and to enhance my understanding of how numbers can be represented in different formats.

## Objectives
- To validate user input to ensure it is a number.
- To convert valid decimal numbers into binary format.
- To display the binary result to the user.

## Planning
The project was planned using flowcharts to visualize the process of input validation, conversion, and output display. Below are the flowcharts that guided the development of this application.

## Features
- Input validation to ensure only valid numbers are processed.
- Real-time conversion of decimal numbers to binary.
- User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## How to Use
1. Enter a decimal number in the input field.
2. The application will check if the input is valid.
3. If valid, the binary equivalent will be displayed; otherwise, an error message will appear.
